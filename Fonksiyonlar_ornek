#Your first task will be to write a greetings function for Julia so she can say hello to her brother Sam.
def greetings(name):
  print("Hello",name)

greetings("cagan")

------------------
Similar to the example we saw in the lesson earlier, let's have a function that takes 2 numbers as an input and returns their difference.

number1=int(input("Birinci sayıyı giriniz:"))
number2=int(input("İkinci sayıyı giriniz:"))
def difference(number1, number2):
  fark=number1-number2
  return fark

difference(number1,number2)
//////////////////////////////Bir de bu yöntem var.
def difference():
    number1 = int(input("Birinci sayıyı giriniz:"))
    number2 = int(input("İkinci sayıyı giriniz:"))
    fark = number1 - number2
    return fark

result = difference()
print("İki sayı arasındaki fark:", result)
------------------
Now, it's your turn to create a function print_introduction that takes these 3 arguments we defined above and print the following sentence:
"I was born on birthday in place of birth and now I live in where she currently lives."

birthday = "4 September 1996"
place_of_birth = "London"
current_city = "London"

def introduction():
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()
///////////////////////////////Değerleri fonksionun içerisine de alabiliriz.
def introduction():
   birthday = "4 September 1996"
   place_of_birth = "London"
   current_city = "London"
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()

-----------------

def city_name():
  sehir="USA"
  return sehir

def introduction():
   global current_city
   birthday = "4 September 1996"
   place_of_birth = "London"
   current_city = city_name()
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()
//////////////////////////////Argüman içine almak için ise böyle bir çalışma yaparız.
sehir="USA"
def city_name(sehir):
  city=sehir
  return city

def introduction():
   global current_city
   birthday = "4 September 1996"
   place_of_birth = "London"
   current_city = city_name(sehir)
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()
