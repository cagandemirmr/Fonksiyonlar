#Your first task will be to write a greetings function for Julia so she can say hello to her brother Sam.
def greetings(name):
  print("Hello",name)

greetings("cagan")

------------------
Similar to the example we saw in the lesson earlier, let's have a function that takes 2 numbers as an input and returns their difference.

number1=int(input("Birinci sayÄ±yÄ± giriniz:"))
number2=int(input("Ä°kinci sayÄ±yÄ± giriniz:"))
def difference(number1, number2):
  fark=number1-number2
  return fark

difference(number1,number2)
//////////////////////////////Bir de bu yÃ¶ntem var.
def difference():
    number1 = int(input("Birinci sayÄ±yÄ± giriniz:"))
    number2 = int(input("Ä°kinci sayÄ±yÄ± giriniz:"))
    fark = number1 - number2
    return fark

result = difference()
print("Ä°ki sayÄ± arasÄ±ndaki fark:", result)
------------------
Now, it's your turn to create a function print_introduction that takes these 3 arguments we defined above and print the following sentence:
"I was born on birthday in place of birth and now I live in where she currently lives."

birthday = "4 September 1996"
place_of_birth = "London"
current_city = "London"

def introduction():
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()
///////////////////////////////DeÄŸerleri fonksionun iÃ§erisine de alabiliriz.
def introduction():
   birthday = "4 September 1996"
   place_of_birth = "London"
   current_city = "London"
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()

-----------------

def city_name():
  sehir="USA"
  return sehir

def introduction():
   global current_city
   birthday = "4 September 1996"
   place_of_birth = "London"
   current_city = city_name()
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()
//////////////////////////////ArgÃ¼man iÃ§ine almak iÃ§in ise bÃ¶yle bir Ã§alÄ±ÅŸma yaparÄ±z.
sehir="USA"
def city_name(sehir):
  city=sehir
  return city

def introduction():
   global current_city
   birthday = "4 September 1996"
   place_of_birth = "London"
   current_city = city_name(sehir)
   print("I was born on",birthday,"in",place_of_birth,"now i live in",current_city)

introduction()
/////////////////////////////
def city_name(city):
    return city

def introduction():
    birthday = "4 September 1996"
    place_of_birth = "London"
    current_city = city_name("New York")  # city_name fonksiyonunu Ã§aÄŸÄ±rÄ±rken bir argÃ¼man geÃ§irin
    print("I was born on", birthday, "in", place_of_birth, "now I live in", current_city)

introduction()

---------------------
Julia finally left the airport and noticed that the weather is not as she expected. It's always good to know the weather forecast in the new city. 

You are provided with a 7 days' weather forecast. In the lesson, we discussed how you can construct a line plot using seaborn. Julia finds line plots confusing, try to create a bar plot for her to find out what the weather will be for the next 7 days. 

ğŸ“Œ Use the *barplot* method from the *seaborn* library with the data below.

import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Weather data
day = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
avg_temperature = [14, 9, 3, 11, 18, 27, 6]

# Creating a DataFrame
weather_data = pd.DataFrame({'Day': day, 'Average Temperature': avg_temperature})

# Using seaborn to create a bar plot
sns.barplot(x='Day', y='Average Temperature', data=weather_data)
